Put simply: The internet is a system that can transfer information from one computer to another.

History:
Originally, called ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network). The US defense department needed a way to share files across the country, starting in and around california for sharing of information around colleges, eventually expanding outside of california and into the rest of the country, even going so far as northern Europe. its a packet based operation, wherein groups of data is sent in a flash across the entire country, bit by bit by bit (no pun intended) 

The internet:
Imagine the internet as a trading post.
Computing is the land that the trading post is on.
The internet is the actual, physical buildings, the framework for the web.
The web is the innards of the store, the merchandise, the people, the inventory, everything.
The users of the post are the customers exchanging and trading goods.![FAQ.PNG]({{site.baseurl}}/FAQ.PNG)
