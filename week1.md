What is a 'flame war' and what does it have to do with emoticons?

A flame war is where two parties engage in hostile conversation with eachother over the web, usually in chatrooms or game chats; the online equivelant of trash-talking. Some notable communities that are famous for flame wars would be: A. Call of Duty, as the lobbies are host to many squeakers (usually young teenagers that havn't hit puberty yet). B. Internet bloodsports, a phenomenon wherein people that have e-drama hash it out with eachother, usually with another party moderating. 
According to the book, emoticons would lead to flamewars, due to people not taking things seriously, OR because people would misinterpret it as something else."Jokey remarks on the computer science bulleitin board were often misinterpreted  and a 'flame war' would result. At best, the original intent of the thread was lost. At Worst, people were offended."

What's the difference between an emoticon and an emoji? Support your answer with references beyond the book.
For what its worth there really isn't a practical difference, the only distinction is that one is an actual character
like this -> ☃
and another is spelled with multiple characters -> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Boulton explains that a JPEG file has 'lossy' compression. Explain what this means. List and explain a few other kinds of image file compression and the image file types associated with them.

Back in the day, storage space expenseive, so people had to get the most out of thier files with the least amount of space possible, nowadays we have the luxury of being able to have files in .png and .gif (and even .raw if you are fancy). Jpeg likes to take image data and compress it as much within reason, zooming into a jpeg always results in lots of artifacting and pixelation. Jpegs also has a very limited palette compaired to other file types, this is why highly compressed jpegs start looking like a palatte rather than a picture. Png allows for transparency, wherein jpeg doesn't.

List and explain a few examples of metadata beyond the examples given in the book.
